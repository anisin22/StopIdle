# StopIdle
To make it seem like you are online at all times. 

Python Program clicks where your cursor is, so make sure to leave cursor somewhere where it will not be opening or closing files.
Also you can quit the program by Crtl-C or pressing the X in the corner. 

Download StopIdle.py to use, need to download libraries to use.

For Batch file, replace the path with the path on your computer to an .exe file that you dont mind opening and closing.
Program runs every minute where it leaves the file open for a minute then closes it and reopens every minute.
